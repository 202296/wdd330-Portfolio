   <h2>User Experience Flow:</h2> 

<ul>
   
  <li>When a user visits the weather web page, they are greeted with a clean and intuitive interface. The page includes a search input field, a search button, and a display area for weather information.
  The user is encouraged to interact with the search functionality by entering the name of a country or city in the search input field. Upon entering the search query, the user can either press the search button or hit the Enter key to initiate the search. User can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit and also between Daily Weather Forecasts and Hourly Weather Forecasts</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>JavaScript functionality is implemented to process the user's search query. The JavaScript code retrieves the entered location from the input field and sends a request to the third-party weather API to fetch the corresponding weather data. While waiting for the API response, the user may be provided with a loading spinner or a message indicating that the data is being retrieved.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>Once the weather data is received from the API, the JavaScript code processes the JSON response, extracting the relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, Ultra Violet Index, Sunrise and Sunset, Visibility, Air Quality, and weather conditions.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>The retrieved weather data is then dynamically displayed on the web page, providing the user with the current weather conditions for the searched location.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>Simultaneously, the searched location is stored in the browser's LocalStorage. This allows the web page to remember the user's last visit and display the previously searched location upon returning to the page.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>CSS is utilized to enhance the visual appeal of the web page. This includes using CSS properties to round the edges of the input field, add shadows to create a sense of depth, and add borders to visually separate different sections of the page. Additionally, CSS animations or transitions can be applied to create subtle movements or transitions, making the page feel more dynamic and engaging.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>The web page also incorporates event listeners to react to user interactions. For example, when the user clicks on the search input field, CSS styles are applied to round the edges, add shadows, and enlarge the input field to provide visual feedback. When the user clicks outside the input field, the CSS styles revert to their original state.</li>
</ul>
